Public Data Sources
==========================

The public data sources are where data is publicly available, rather than data provided by a specific partner.

## Crossref – Events
Crossref Event Data captures online discussion about research outputs, such as ‘a citation in a dataset or patent, a mention in a news article, Wikipedia page or on a blog, or discussion and comment on social media’ (<https://www.crossref.org/services/event-data/>). The event data is retrieved using the Crossref Events API (<https://www.eventdata.crossref.org/guide/service/query-api/>).
