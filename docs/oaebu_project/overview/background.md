Project Background
=======================

## Developing a Pilot Data Trust for Open Access eBook Usage
The project, Developing a Pilot Data Trust for Open Access eBook Usage ('OAeBU data dashboard pilot', January 2020 to March 2022) was a two-year project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (<https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1596980/>). The project developed systems for gathering information about open access eBooks and their usage from multiple data sources, combining and presenting it in a series of online interactive visualization dashboards for eBook publisher partners. 

Presenting usage information can be complex, because open access eBooks can be hosted in multiple repositories, in different file formats (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, HTML), and in different levels (whole book or by chapter). Each repository provides book content to different audiences in different ways. 

The data sources in the OAeBU data dashboard pilot included general bibliographic data from public datasets (Crossref and OAPEN) and usage data from multiple platforms (OAPEN, JSTOR, Google Books, Google Analytics, UCL Discovery). The data from these sources are integrated with publisher data via the book-specific metadata standard, ONIX. These data sources are continuously refreshed, so that the online dashboards are up to date. 

The online dashboard enables publisher partners to see the usage of the eBooks they have published in terms of views, downloads and online mentions and events. Publisher partners can also view which countries and institutions are using their eBooks, and which subjects are represented in their open access eBook collections. The data shown in the dashboards is visible only to each publisher partner about their own collection. However, the University of Michigan Press have shared their online dashboards publicly, with no login details required:
