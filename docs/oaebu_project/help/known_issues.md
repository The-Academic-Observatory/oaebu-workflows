## Warning message ‘Terms list might be incomplete ...’ 

In the bespoke dashboard sections where data is manually uploaded (such as the University of Michigan Press’s Fulcrum, MUSE and EBSCO dashboards), a warning message may appear on the filters: ‘Terms list might be incomplete because the request is taking too long…’. This is an expected warning message for this dashboard, and these filters can still be used.

## Error ‘No results found’ when select an individual year in a table
When a year filter is added by clicking the + sign in a table, the error ‘No results found’ may appear. The error message may then also appear in the dashboard filters ‘Filtering occurs on the … field, which doesn’t exist on any documents in the … index pattern’.

This is a known issue. The dashboard can be reloaded by clicking on the relevant dashboard link in the navigation menu at the top right of each dashboard. To view data for a specific year, filter via any of the bar graphs rather than the tables.
