BAD Project Background
=======================

## BAD Project Description
The Book Analytics Dashboard Project (2022-2025) is focused on creating a sustainable OA Book focused analytics service. This service is needed to safeguard and support diversity in the voices, perspectives, geographies, topics and languages made visible through OA Books. Funded by the [Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), the Book Analytics Dashboard project is building on an earlier Mellon-funded initiative: [Developing a Pilot Data Trust for OA eBook Usage (2020 â€“ 2022)](https://educopia.org/data_trust/). In addition to scaling workflows, infrastructure and customer support, the Demonstration Project is developing a long-term plan for housing, maintenance and funding of the analytics service as a sustainable community infrastructure.

The pilot project developed a prototype dashboard for gathering book usage information from multiple data sources, and combining and presenting it in interactive visualisation dashboards for publisher partners. This pilot project is now in the process of scaling up to a full Dashboard service in 2022-2025. See the [BAD template dashboard here](http:/template.book-analytics.org/).
